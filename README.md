# PintosScheduling

This project implements an efficient alarm clock mechanism and priority-based thread scheduling for PintOS.

## Features

- **Efficient Alarm Clock**: Optimized timer interrupt handling for thread sleeping and waking
- **Priority Scheduling**: Thread scheduling based on priority levels with preemption support
- **Priority Donation**: Prevents priority inversion through priority inheritance

## Overview

Implementation of advanced scheduling algorithms in the PintOS operating system, focusing on:
- Reducing busy waiting in alarm clock operations
- Implementing priority-based scheduling with proper preemption
- Handling priority donation to avoid priority inversion issues
